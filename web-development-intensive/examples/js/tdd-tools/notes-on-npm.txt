Notes on npm 

* npm install *

- short version: 'npm i'
- has several different signatures

- without arguments 
-- 'npm i'
-- looks for nearest package.json in folders above
-- if found, fetches & installs packages 
-- always installs packages listed in 'dependencies'
-- installs packages listed in 'devDependencies' if dev environment variable set (this is default)
-- set env var to production for deployment

- arguments: one or more package names
-- 'npm i package-one package-two'
-- fetches, installs, and exits

- saving flags
-- 'npm i [-S/-D] package-one package-two'
-- with flag, fetches & installs and also writes to package.json
-- '--save' or alias '-S' save to dependencies
-- '--save-dev' or alias '-D' save to devDependencies

*running packages*

- npm installs to a folder called 'node_modules'
- to run a package directly, find the executable inside node_modules
- usually in a subdir named 'bin' or 'dist' (may or may not end in .js)
- to run, pass the executable path to node
- ex: 'node node_modules/karma/bin/karma'
- some packages may require additional arguments
- ex: 'node node_modules/karma/bin/karma init' (note the space after karma - 'init' is an argument to karma)

* package.json *

- 'name' field
-- your project name
-- takes the folder name by default
-- name cannot be the same as any package you intend to use
-- npm will error if you try to install something with the same name

- 'scripts' field
-- an object 
-- object properties become script names
-- property values are strings which contain bash code
-- you can refer to packages by name inside script strings (even if they're not installed globally)

- 'dependencies' field
-- a list of packages to always be installed 

- 'devDependencies' field
-- a list of packages to be installed when environment variable set to development
-- this is the default
-- setting the variable to 'production' causes these packages not to be installed
-- this is useful on a deployment machine
-- add packages to this field that the client should not receive
-- ex: testing tools, task runners
